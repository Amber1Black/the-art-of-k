In the second half of 2024, two major exhibitions - Barbie and Enzo Mari - are taking center stage.

        <p>I have a deep passion for design, I always enjoy spending times at the Design Museum. It beautifully illustrates that design is not just about aesthetics but also about how products can enhance the user’s experience. The exhibits are visually stunning, with a harmonious blend of colors that is incredibly appealing. Everything is easily assessible - the explanations and displays are easy to understand, making it a place for everyone to enjoy. Plus, the museum is perfectly located next to Holland Park and not far from Kensington Gardens, making it an ideal spot for a day out - immerse ourselves in the world of design, then unwind with a peaceful stroll through the park.</p>
