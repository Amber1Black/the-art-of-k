In the second half of 2024, two major exhibitions - Barbie and Enzo Mari - are taking center stage.

        <p>I have a deep passion for design, I always enjoy spending times at the Design Museum. It beautifully illustrates that design is not just about aesthetics but also about how products can enhance the userâ€™s experience. The exhibits are visually stunning, with a harmonious blend of colors that is incredibly appealing. Everything is easily assessible - the explanations and displays are easy to understand, making it a place for everyone to enjoy. Plus, the museum is perfectly located next to Holland Park and not far from Kensington Gardens, making it an ideal spot for a day out - immerse ourselves in the world of design, then unwind with a peaceful stroll through the park.</p>
